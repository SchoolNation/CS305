# CS305
Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
The main reason Artemis Financial wanted to address was the overall security of their product. This included new processes for encryption/decrytion and using a HTTPS

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
Finding the appropriate tools for what needed to be done was done well for this client in my opinion. This and secure coding is important for security for the users and even more so when you are involving the money and lots of it along with very personal and sensitive information from your users.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
Maven dependency check made it much easier to handle the assessment. It is a lot of information to take in at once but it is a lot faster then the alternative of doing it all yourself.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
Again Maven dependency check is a great way to assess vulnerablilities and can even give insight on how to fix the issues. Another thing is more testing to try and brute force any vulnerabilities that could potentially be an issue.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
Testing the code to make suire it works after anything new is added. Running the dependency check before and after something is added can show if any new vulnerability show up.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Maven dependency check is a tool I believe will be very usful for furture tasks. It seems to be a very efficient way to spot some issues and allow more effort to be placed on other parts of a project.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
There is a heavy focus on security in this project and effort put into making sure a client gets the best available product. There is also some work done with hash and encryptions.
